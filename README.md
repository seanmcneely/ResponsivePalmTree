# ResponsivePalmTree
This JavaScript project allows you to add a fully responsive and interactive palm tree animation to an html webpage! 

The tree is built using p5js, a javascript libary that allows you to create animations by drawing simple shapes. Creating the tree turned out to be far more
challenging than I initially predicted, and was super fun.
